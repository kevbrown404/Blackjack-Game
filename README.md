# Blackjack Card Game
Try your luck at our virtual Blackjack table and risk the chance of losing everything you own! A standard deck of cards has four suites: hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds. Each suit has thirteen cards: ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen and king. The whole deck has 52 cards total.
#
The goal of the game is to defeat the dealer. Blackjack hands are scored by their point total. The hand with the highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21; a hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and face cards (jack, queen, king) are also worth 10. The ace card, will equal 11, unless the hand point total is more than 21; if that's the case, the value of the ace drops down to 1.

# MVP Goals:
1. As a player, I can view randomly generated cards for both the dealer and my hands.
2. As a player, I will have the buttons to either 'hit' or 'stay' to win the game.
 - 'Hit' meaning another card will be randomly generated to increase the value of the player's hand.
 - 'Stay' meaning the original value of the hand will be locked in, to face the value of the dealers hand.
3. As a player, I can view one of the three cards will be facing down, and will be flipped once my turn is
   over.
4. As a player, I should be able to view the dealers hand and calculate the combined values of their cards.
5. As a player, I may be able to 'hit' as many times as I want until the cards have exceeded the combined value of 21.
6. As a player, in order for me to see 'you win,' I must succeed in having a higher value hand than that of the dealers hand, with the value not being greater than 21.
7. As a player, I will 'lose' if.. my hand < dealer's hand 
# Stretch Goals:
1. Display an animated hand to flip cards.
2. Implement an animation of cards to show them flipping over.
3. Show cards moving from a deck to both the dealer and the players side of the board.
4. Include a currency system.
